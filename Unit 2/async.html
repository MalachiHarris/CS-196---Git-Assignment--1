        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This project works with the basic syntax of async functions, and the await keyword. and the 
            await keyword and the promise object.
            <br><br>

            In it we have a async function named OneRun().
            we create and set two vars(runner1,runner2) to track results of promises
            Then we create set two ints to random #'s between 1000 & 3000. These are used for delays which differ.
            lastly there is a string created and set to "", this will later be used to output to console which "runner" wins, #1 or #2.
            <br><br>

            Then we create a promise for each runner. They are named runner1Go & runner2Go.
            the parmeter for a promise is a function that will run in parallel while other code also executes.
            In this rather simple example each of the 2 promises simply run a SetTimeout() funciton.
            <br><br>

            The set timeout function also takes a function as a parameter, but also a delay as 
            the second parameter(normally named ms as the delay is in milliseconds). The set timeout
            runs the code in the function after the time of the delay has passed. Our setTimeout functions
            simply set the loser string variable to "runner1" or "runner2" according ot their respective
             promise, and then resolve the promise with a value of true.
            <br><br>

             then at the end of the OneRun async function, we return an array containing the results of runner1 & runner2
             variables,  and the loser string.  we use await on runner1Go and runner2Go. This makes the code wait
             for the promises to finish and give their result.
             <br><br>

             finally we simply call the async function and use a 'then' method 
             which takes a function as a parameter.That function takes a parameter which is the result
              of the async function. Inside of that we simply have code to log the result to the console.
               See this pages console and you will see the array with a value of true, true, and a string 
               that tells you who the "loser" is(the promise that was assigned the higher delay)
